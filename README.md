# 📚 Semantic Book Recommender

This is a semantic search–based book recommendation system that uses natural language processing to recommend books based on user input. Instead of relying on fixed keywords or categories, it understands the **meaning** behind your input using **sentence embeddings**.

### 🔍 How It Works

- Uses `sentence-transformers` (Hugging Face) to generate semantic embeddings from book descriptions.
- To create your own vector database, you’ll need a .env file in the root directory containing either your OpenAI API key or Hugging Face token.
- Stores and searches embeddings using FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search).
- A Gradio interface that allows users to enter a query and receive book recommendations.
- Input can be anything — a topic, mood, summary, or even a quote — and you'll get the most semantically relevant books.
